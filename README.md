# CxAnalytix

CxAnalytix is a background process that crawls Checkmarx SAST, OSA, and Management & Orchestration APIs to 
obtain data about vulnerabilities.  The data is then flattened into a JSON format with the intent to be forwarded to a data analytics 
platform for analysis.  Analysis can be performed on the data alone or in aggregate with other sources of data.

The fields available in generated documents can be found in the [specification](SPEC.md).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

CxAnalytix is built on .Net Core and is therefore capable of running on Windows or Linux.  

There are several installation variations:

* A Windows service
* A Linux daemon
* A command line executable

### Installation

Please refere to the [Installation](https://github.com/checkmarx-ts/CxAnalytix/wiki/Installation) wiki page


## Additional Documentation
