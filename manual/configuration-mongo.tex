\subsection{MongoDB Output Configuration}\label{sec:mongo_config}


\subsubsection{MongoDB Connection String Configuration}

The MongoDB connection is configured with a connection string following the \href{https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/}{MongoDB URI Format}.
XML reserved characters will need to be XML escaped:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{"} \ \faArrowRight \ \texttt{\&quot;}
    \item \textbf{'} \ \faArrowRight \ \texttt{\&apos;}
    \item \textbf{<} \ \faArrowRight \ \texttt{\&lt;}
    \item \textbf{>} \ \faArrowRight \ \texttt{\&gt;}
    \item \textbf{\&} \ \faArrowRight \ \texttt{\&amp;}
\end{itemize}

\noindent\\Other special characters that are not valid in a URL may need to be \href{https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP}{URL Encoded}.\\

\begin{xml}{CxMongoConnection}{\expandsenv\encrypts}{}
<CxMongoConnection
    ConnectionString="mongodb://<server>:27017/<database>"
/>
\end{xml}


\subsubsection{AWS DocumentDB Connection String Configuration}

AWS DocumentDB has a MongoDB compatible API, making it suitable for
use with CxAnalytix.  The configuration console of a DocumentDB cluster will
provide a MongoDB URI that refers to the\\\texttt{rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem}
file.  The PEM file contains the AWS Certificate Authority chain for 
DocumentDB client SSL/TLS
communication, and must be installed correctly on the machine running
CxAnalytix.

\noindent\\The URI provided in the DocumentDB cluster console does not
generally work for the MongoDB driver used by CxAnalytix.  After 
following one of the below platform-specific certificate installation
procedures, the MongoDB URI can now be formatted as:

\noindent\\\texttt{mongodb://user:password@machine:27017/database?ssl=true\&retryWrites=false}


\noindent\\If the AWS CA bundle is not installed correctly, CxAnalytix
logs will emit connection errors indicating the CA chain cannot be 
validated for the DocumentDB server connection.


\paragraph{AWS DocumentDB Configuration for Windows}


\noindent\\\\For Windows, the requirement is to import the AWS RDS CA bundle
into the local machine's Trusted Root Authority certificate store.  The 
\texttt{rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem} PEM
file\footnote{https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem}
referenced on AWS documentation is not compatible with importing into the
Windows certificate store.  Instead, the \texttt{rds-combined-ca-bundle.p7b} P7B version of the file
\footnote{https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.p7b}
should be used instead.\footnote{The URLs for the certificate bundles 
were valid as of the time this document was written.  You may need to find
the current location of the P7B form of the AWS certificate bundle.}

\noindent\\To import the P7B certificate bundle, open PowerShell as
an administator and issue the following command:\\


\begin{code}{PowerShell Certificate Bundle Import Command}{}{}
Import-Certificate -FilePath <path>\rds-combined-ca-bundle.p7b -CertStoreLocation cert:\LocalMachine\Root
\end{code}



\paragraph{AWS DocumentDB Configuration for Linux}

\noindent\\\\Linux, unlike Windows, requires the 
\texttt{rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem} PEM file
\footnote{https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem}
as the source of the AWS CA certificate bundle.  Installing the AWS CA 
certificate bundle on Linux\footnote{This was tested
on Amazon Linux but should apply to other Linux distributions.} is done
with the following commands:\\

\begin{code}{Linux Certificate Bundle Import Commands}{}{}
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem
sudo cp rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem /usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/anchors/
sudo update-ca-trust
\end{code}
   

\subsubsection{MongoDB Shard Keys}

The \texttt{CxMongoOutput} configuration element is optional; it can be used to add an additional field to each record
added to an output record with a name matching the record name configuration described in Section \ref{sec:runtime_config}.  The fields
available for each record can be found in Appendix \ref{chap:spec}. Details about creating shard keys can be found in Appendix \ref{ShardKeyCookbook}.

\noindent\\The example \texttt{CxMongoOutput} element below shows a shard key with the name \texttt{pkey} added to documents
written to collections named \texttt{SAST\_Scan\_Summary} and \texttt{SAST\_Scan\_Detail}.

\begin{xml}{CxMongoOutput}{\contentvariables}{}
<CxMongoOutput>
    <GeneratedShardKeys>
        <Spec 
            KeyName="pkey" 
            CollectionName="SAST_Scan_Summary" 
            FormatSpec="{ScanType}-{ScanFinished:yyyy-dddd}"
            />
        <Spec 
            KeyName="pkey" 
            CollectionName="SAST_Scan_Detail" 
            FormatSpec="{ScanType}-{QueryGroup}-{ScanFinished:yyyy-dddd}" 
            NoHash="true" 
            />
    </GeneratedShardKeys>
</CxMongoOutput>
\end{xml}

    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{cccl}

        \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Default} & \textbf{Required} & \textbf{Description}\\

        containing this shard key value are written.}\\
        \midrule
        \texttt{FormatSpec} & N/A & Yes & \makecell[l]{A specifier composed of static values\\
        and dynamic values extracted from the document\\
        prior to being written to the collection.}\\
        \midrule
        \texttt{NoHash} & False & No & \makecell[l]{When False, the value created by the \texttt{FormatSpec}\\
        attribute is written as a Base64 encoded hash\\
        to the field with the name defined by\\
        the \texttt{KeyName} attribute.  Otherwise, the\\
        unhashed value is written.}\\
