\chapter{Data Field Specification}\label{chap:spec}

This chapter details the data fields output in each record type by Checkmarx product. Some fields may be omitted if they are not provided
by the source data.  (e.g. OSA records or OSA related fields would not be included in a record output if a project was not being scanned
using OSA.)  Data records can be considered a snapshot of the state of the vulnerabilities at the time the scan data was crawled.
