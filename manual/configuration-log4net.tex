\subsection{Log4Net Output Configuration}\label{sec:log4net_out}

The Log4Net configuration is typically limited to modifying the \texttt{cxanalytics.log4net} file to modify the output paths of the
data output files.  Modifying the output location is described in Section \ref{sec:log4net_out}.

\noindent\\The \texttt{CxLogOutput} optional configuration can be used to periodically purge the files created by CxAnalytix As
scans are crawled over time.  It is presumed that the files created are being forwarded for storage, thus can be purged periodically.

\begin{xml}{CxLogOutput}{}{}
<CxLogOutput DataRetentionDays="14" OutputRoot="logs\">
    <PurgeSpecs>
        <spec MatchSpec="*.log.*" />
    </PurgeSpecs>
</CxLogOutput>
\end{xml}
            
\begin{table}[h]
    \caption{CxLogOutput Attributes}        
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{cccl}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Attribute} & \textbf{Default} & \textbf{Required} & \textbf{Description}\\
        \midrule
        \texttt{DataRetentionDays} & N/A & Yes & \makecell[l]{The maximum number of days a file can be\\
        untouched before purge.}\\
        \midrule
        \texttt{OutputRoot} & N/A & Yes & \makecell[l]{The root folder where logs are written.}\\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\noindent\\The \texttt{PurgeSpecs} element contains one or more \texttt{spec} child elements.  The attribute \texttt{MatchSpec} in each \texttt{spec} element
defines a file mask used for selecting files to purge.  The search for files matching one or more of the specifications are performed recursively
from the root.  Any files found matching one or more of the specifications are purged if the last modified date is older than the value configured
in the \texttt{DataRetentionDays} element.
