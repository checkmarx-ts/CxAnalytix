\chapter*{Foreward}

As vulnerability scans are performed, a significant amount of data is generated over time.  The
scan data is normally consumed by development teams to remediate issues found in their specific 
projects.  The development team will perform triage and code changes as they assess what is required 
from the scan results. 

CxAnalytix was created when managment teams expressed the desire to create dashboards with
aggregated views of vulnerabilities across all scanning activity.  While CxAnalytix itself
does not produce these dashboards, it crawls scan results and collects the vulnerability
data that is then integrated into custom dashboards.\\\\

CxAnalytix currently supports the following Checkmarx products:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Checkmarx SAST (including OSA and Management \& Orchestration)
    \item Checkmarx SCA
\end{itemize}

The documentation for CxAnalytix was moved from the GitHub Wiki as of version 2.0.  This
manual will serve as the source of CxAnalytix documentation.  The manual will be updated
and versioned with each CxAnalytix release.
